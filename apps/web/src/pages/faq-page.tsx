This is post-decode ensembling, not coherent integration — summing per-frame log-probabilities before the CTC decode (for a true ~√2 SNR gain) is noted as future work.',
          'The human is capped at one listen (MAX_LISTENS = 1). The clip asymmetry is deliberate and surfaced per-round: the SNR and WPM of both clips are shown in the result, and the “How the bot got two looks” detail explains the merge step.',
